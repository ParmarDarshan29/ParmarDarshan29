🔭 I’m currently working on everything my brain decides is a “great idea” at 3 AM.
🌱 I’m learning so many things, probably too many things:
    - A data science project (I promised my group I'd help)
    - College syllabus (it’s a rollercoaster and I didn’t sign up)
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source stuff! If there’s code and community, count me in.
🤔 I’m looking for help with…uh, honestly? Anything. I love learning random things from people who know random things.
💬 Ask me about…actually, maybe just message and see where it goes 😄
📫 How to reach me: Digital carrier pigeon (or DM)
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I still don’t know what my dream job is, but I’m working towards it anyway.
💫 About Me: I'm on a mission to become the AI expert everyone warned you about. I have a case of “Do and Overthink” Syndrome.
Some fun things about me:
I can’t cook (yet).
I’m attempting to be a:
Data Science Explorer
Python Enthusiast
AI/Ambition-Aficionado
GitHub Connoisseur
Future Expert in All Things Tech
